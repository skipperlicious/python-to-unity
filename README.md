# python-to-unity

Small example of a project I did about sending python data to Unity.

### Prerequisites

You will need both Unity and Python installed on your pc to run this. I recommend using conda if you are using packages in your python script. Remember to install your packages in the right environment. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/skipperlicious/python-to-unity
   ```
2. Open example scene in Unity
3. Press play

You can tune the "PythontoUnity" C# script to use the conda .bat launcher instead of plain Python. If you want to run you own python script, just replace the name of the python script inside the .bat file.
